# Thread Information Block



On x86 32bit windows the `FS` segment register points to a structure called the [Thread Information Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32_Thread_Information_Block) or the TIB for short. This structure is created by the kernel on thread creation and is used to support OS related functionalities, services and APIs.

Examples of data TIB usage are:

1. Thread Local Storage.
2. the Heap.
3. the Stack.
4. SEH exception chain.
5. Access to the Process Environment Block \(which serves a similar, process level goal\).
