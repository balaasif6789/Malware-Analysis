# Anatomy of a Windows PE C program

Source: [https://malwareunicorn.org/workshops/re101.html\#3](https://malwareunicorn.org/workshops/re101.html#3)

Typical windows programs are in the Portable Executable \(PE\) Format. It's portable because it contains information, resources, and references to dynamic-linked libraries \(DLL\) that allows windows to load and execute the machine code.

### Windows Architecture

In this workshop we will be focusing on user-mode applications.

#### User-mode vs. Kernel Mode[ \[1\]](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/user-mode-and-kernel-mode?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396)

* In user-mode, an application starts a user-mode process which comes with its own private virtual address space and handle table
* In kernel mode, applications share virtual address space.

This diagram shows the relationship of application components for user-mode and kernel-mode.

### PE Header

The PE header provides information to operating system on how to map the file into memory. The executable code has designated regions that require a different memory protection \(RWX\)

* Read
* Write
* Execute

Here is a hexcode dump of a PE header we will be working with.

### Memory Layout

* **Stack** - region of memory is added or removed using "last-in-first-out" \(LIFO\) procedure[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28abstract_data_type%29)
* **Heap** - region for dynamic memory allocation[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_%28data_structure%29)
* **Program Image** - The PE executable code placed into memory
* **DLLs** - Loaded DLL images that are referenced by the PE
* **TEB** - Thread Environment Block stores information about the current running thread\(s\)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32_Thread_Information_Block)
* **PEB** - Process Environment Block stores information about loaded modules and processes.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_Environment_Block)

### The Stack

* Data is either pushed onto or popped off of the stack data structure
* **EBP** - Base Pointer is the register that used to store the references in the stack frame
