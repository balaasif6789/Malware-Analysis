# Triage Analysis

### Check the file header

Open the file in the hex editor **HxD.**

Notice the first 2 bytes are **MZ** meaning it's a PE Binary

### Check the PE header information

Add the file extension **.exe** to the **Unknown** file so that it reads as **Unknown.exe**. Load the file in **PE Bear** to check the PE header information.

* Select the Import Directory in the navigation tree
* Notice that is using[**FindResourceA**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-findresourcea) and[**CreateProcessA**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa). This means the executable might be extracting something out of the resource section and run it as a new process.

### Collect the MD5 hash

Select the File information in the PE Bear navigation tree to collect the MD5 hash and SHA1 Hash.

Go to[virustotal.com](http://virustotal.com/) and search based on hash. See if there are any search results.

### Open the file in **BinText**

Next open the file in **BinText** program and note any interesting strings.

### Quick Detonation 

In this the suspicious file is executed in a VM. The VM, let's call this Victim VM is connected to another VM, let's call this Sniffer VM. 

The VMs are configured such that the traffic from the victim VM passes through the sniffer VM. The sniffer VM has INetsim installed. This simulates internet services in the VM.

We can use Systeinternals suite , namely procmon and procexp to monitor running processes. 

We can use Wireshark  for monitoring network traffic.
