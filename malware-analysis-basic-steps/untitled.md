# Triage Analysis

### Check the file header

Open the file in the hex editor **HxD.**

Notice the first 2 bytes are **MZ** meaning it's a PE Binary

### Check the PE header information

Add the file extension **.exe** to the **Unknown** file so that it reads as **Unknown.exe**. Load the file in **PE Bear** to check the PE header information.

* Select the Import Directory in the navigation tree
* Notice that is using[**FindResourceA**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-findresourcea) and[**CreateProcessA**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa). This means the executable might be extracting something out of the resource section and run it as a new process.
